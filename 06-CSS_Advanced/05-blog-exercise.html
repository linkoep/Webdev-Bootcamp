      Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. In painting, you 
      have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend 
      rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. 
      The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.

      Nothing wrong with washing your brush. I'll go over the colors one more time 
      that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, 
      Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Follow the lay of 
      the land. It's most important. You can do anything your heart can imagine.

      If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. This is gonna be a 
      happy little seascape. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
      And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.

      This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Let your 
      heart be your guide. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will 
      be. You're special. You're so very special.

      Work that paint. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Isn't that 
      fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. With 
      practice comes confidence. This is unplanned it really just happens. It's 
      amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.

      Let's do it again then, what the heck. Just go back and put one little more 
      happy tree in there. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

      You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. 
      That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint
      . What the devil. And just raise cain.

      In your world you can create anything you desire. If you don't like it - 
      change it. It's your world. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

      Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. 
      Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these 
      things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Talk to trees, look at the 
      birds. Whatever it takes. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. 
      You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Once you learn the 
      technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.
