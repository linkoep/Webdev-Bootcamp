/* Javascript has five primitive data types */

//Numbers
//Strings
//	Strings are surrounded by single or double quotes
//	Backslash is used as an escape character
//Booleans
//null 
//	Null explicitly expresses nothingness
//undefined
//	Variables that are declared but not initialized are undefined

//We can play around with these data types in the console (or in node on the terminal)

/* We store data in variables */

//Javascript is a dynamically typed language
//We will use camelCase for variable naming

/* There are some useful built-in functions we can use to display output */

//console.log() prints to the console
//alert() creates a pop-up
//prompt() lets us get input from a user


/* We can write javascript in a separate file and include it in our html */
